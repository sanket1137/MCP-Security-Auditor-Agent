# ðŸ“„ Business Requirements Document (BRD)

**Project Title:** MCP Directory & Security Analysis Agent  
**Prepared By:** Development Team  
**Date:** August 6, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Project Overview

The goal is to build an Agentic AI Model integrated into an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server, which can:

- Discover and list all available MCP servers registered or discoverable for use with VS Code or compatible tools.
- Perform automated security analysis on discovered MCP servers for potential threats, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities.

This will be an extensible, pluggable agent that can be embedded in VS Code or operated as a standalone CLI/HTTP tool.

---

## 2. Business Goals & Objectives

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| G1 | Provide a centralized listing of all publicly/locally discoverable MCP servers |
| G2 | Perform static and dynamic security assessments of MCP server APIs |
| G3 | Offer developer-friendly integration with VS Code and other IDEs |
| G4 | Help developers and organizations audit the health and security of their AI infrastructure |
| G5 | Create a community-trusted registry of MCP endpoints |

---

## 3. Scope

### In Scope

**Agent discovery of MCP servers via:**
- Local workspace scanning
- VS Code extension registry
- Remote MCP server index (optional API feed)

**Security analysis:**
- TLS/SSL status
- API permission checks
- Authentication & token validation
- Endpoint sanitization checks

**Interface for listing + reporting in:**
- CLI
- VS Code extension panel

**Report generation:**
- JSON
- Markdown/HTML
- Optional integration with GitHub Security tab

### Out of Scope
- Fixing vulnerabilities automatically
- Listing non-MCP AI agents/tools
- Deep static code analysis of the MCP server source

## 4. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement Description |
|----|------------------------|
| FR1 | The system shall scan for active MCP servers using a known discovery protocol (e.g., HTTP registry, local JSON config) |
| FR2 | The agent shall verify endpoint availability, supported methods, and metadata (name, version, owner) |
| FR3 | The agent shall check for SSL certificate validity and expiry |
| FR4 | The agent shall perform API endpoint fuzzing and check for open routes without auth |
| FR5 | The agent shall create a formatted report with a security score for each MCP server |
| FR6 | The agent shall integrate with VS Code as a sidebar extension |
| FR7 | The system shall expose a local CLI or HTTP endpoint for programmatic use |
| FR8 | The agent shall auto-update the list of known MCP servers periodically or via webhook trigger |

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

| NFR ID | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| NFR1 | Must support execution on Windows, macOS, and Linux |
| NFR2 | Must complete scanning within 30 seconds for up to 50 MCP servers |
| NFR3 | Must maintain logs of past scans for up to 30 days |
| NFR4 | Security analysis should have less than 5% false positives |
| NFR5 | Extension must not block VS Code main thread during scan |

---

## 6. Stakeholders

| Role | Stakeholder | Responsibility |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Product Owner | Development Team | Vision and prioritization |
| Developer | Dev Team | Builds core engine and integrations |
| Security Analyst | Security Team | Defines checks and scoring |
| End User | Developer / Org | Uses tool for discovery and validation |

---

## 7. Assumptions

- MCP servers expose a well-defined metadata endpoint (like `/metadata` or `/info`)
- Servers respond over HTTP or WebSocket
- Developers are willing to register or expose their MCP server configs
- Users understand basic security concepts

---

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Some MCP servers may block or limit scans | Implement timeouts and polite headers |
| Security analysis could raise legal concerns if run on 3rd party servers | Add disclaimer and allow opt-in scanning |
| VS Code API version may change | Regularly update the extension based on API changes |

---

## 9. Deliverables

- MCP Discovery CLI tool (Node.js/TypeScript-based)
- VS Code extension: "MCP Inspector"
- REST API for directory and scanning
- Security scan report template (HTML/JSON)
- GitHub Actions integration (optional)

---

## 10. Timeline (Estimated)

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | 2 weeks | CLI Tool MVP with local discovery |
| Phase 2 | 2 weeks | Security Scanner module |
| Phase 3 | 1 week | VS Code UI Panel |
| Phase 4 | 1 week | Testing & Documentation |
